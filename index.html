                    Hello! My name is Edward Lopus and I am an aspiring coder. I graduated from Florida State University with a B.S. in Statistics and a minor in Business. During my time at Florida State I utilized different programs such as Python, SQL, SAS, and R. I have always had a great liking for coding but I knew that I wanted to use code as a primary skill and not a secondary skill. I enrolled in the University of Denver Fullstack Web Developer in hope of taking my coding skills to the next level. Here you will be able to see all of my work that I have completed as well as my contact information if you think my skills can be of use to you! Please look through my portfolio and let me know what you think!
