# Edward_Lopus_Portfolio
This portfolio will be allow me showcase my skills and talents to employers and I can continually update it throughout the course of this bootcamp.
## Description
This application is the first portfolio I ever created that represents my developing projects. It built using only css styling and html. It is the base model of my current portfolio but it achieves all of its functional goals to show my improvement in skills to the world. It has five deployed application/repositories in the work section and brief section regarding my background and why I decided to start a career in web development. My contact information is at the bottom and all of these sections can be reached via the navigation bar at the top of the page.

## Usage
Open the portfolio by opening the html through with your default browser. You will then be brought to my portfolio page.

If you click on the images of any application than it will take you directly to the deployed version or it's github repository page if it is a backend-only application. Please enjoy my portfolio!
